## Setting up

In this workshop we will learn some common ways of interacting with Git and
GitHub.

To follow along with this interactive workshop you will need a free
[Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account) and a free
[GitHub account](https://github.com/join). You can follow the links to create
these accounts now, or you can create them when they are needed during the
workshop.

You can also find a set of accompanying Google Slides at
[![Slides](https://img.shields.io/badge/slides-learn--github-yellow.svg)][slides].

## Getting started

To start the workshop you can use either Microsofts Azure or MyBinder.
Microsoft Azure is the preferred way as notebook 4 cannot be followed on
MyBinder.

- **Microsoft Azure** [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)][azure]  

  Click the link
  [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)][azure]. This
  will take you to a new webpage that will ask you to import the repository.

  Click the `Import` button. You will then be asked to sign in with your
  Microsoft account. If you haven't already created one then you can create one
  now. Once you have logged in you will see a new window
  `Upload GitHub Repository`.

  You can leave all of the setting as their defaults. Click the `Import`
  button. After a few minutes a new project will be created for you.

  Click the button with the label `Run on Free Co...`. This will open a
  new tab which will display all the files you will need to follow this
  workshop.

  You should wait for 5 minutes to allow your new project to be initialised.
  This will make sure that all the notebooks in this workshop can run.
  After waiting five minues you can click on the `learn-github` folder
  link. This will display a list of all the notebooks for this workshop.

- **MyBinder** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)][binder]

  Click the link [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)][binder]. This will
  automatically take you to a webpage where your interactive environment will
  be created and the `1-introduction.ipynb` will be opened for you.
