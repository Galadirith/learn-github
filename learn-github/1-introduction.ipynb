    "In this workshop we will learn some common ways of interacting with Git and GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow along with this interactive workshop you will need a free [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account) and a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). You can follow the links to create these accounts now, or you can create them when they are needed during the workshop.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a modern version control system. A version control system records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later ([About Version Control, Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)). GitHub is an online services that helps people share projects that use Git as their version control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment that you are viewing this notebook in is called Jupyter. You have access to a file browser which you can access by clicking `File > Open...`. You can also access a terminal window by clicking `File > Open...` and then on the right hand side of the screen selecting `New ▾ > Terminal` which can be used with common Linux commands. This will open up terminal in a new tab.\n",

For example in [2 Manage projects with Git](./2-manage-projects-with-git.ipynb#4-Browse-your-repositories-history) there is a link to learn more about the [git-log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) command. Solutions to the workshop exercises will be provided after the workshop."
